Of all these iterations (including the original), the American series has been the longest-running, spanning 201 episodes over nine seasons.</p>\n<p>In this notebook, we will take a look at a dataset of The Office episodes, and try to understand how the popularity and quality of the series varied over time. To do so, we will use the following dataset: <code>datasets/office_episodes.csv</code>, which was downloaded from Kaggle <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/nehaprabhavalkar/the-office-dataset\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This dataset contains information on a variety of characteristics of each episode. In detail, these are:\n<br></p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #efebe4; color: #05192d; text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; padding: 15px 25px 15px 25px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n    <div style=\"font-size:20px\"><b>datasets/office_episodes.csv</b></div>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>episode_number:</b> Canonical episode number.</li>\n    <li><b>season:</b> Season in which the episode appeared.</li>\n    <li><b>episode_title:</b> Title of the episode.</li>\n    <li><b>description:</b> Description of the episode.</li>\n    <li><b>ratings:</b> Average IMDB rating.</li>\n    <li><b>votes:</b> Number of votes.</li>\n    <li><b>viewership_mil:</b> Number of US viewers in millions.</li>\n    <li><b>duration:</b> Duration in number of minutes.</li>\n    <li><b>release_date:</b> Airdate.</li>\n    <li><b>guest_stars:</b> Guest stars in the episode (if any).</li>\n    <li><b>director:</b> Director of the episode.</li>\n    <li><b>writers:</b> Writers of the episode.</li>\n    <li><b>has_guests:</b> True/False column for whether the episode contained guest stars.</li>\n    <li><b>scaled_ratings:</b> The ratings scaled from 0 (worst-reviewed) to 1 (best-reviewed).</li>\n</ul>\n    </div>","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"4"},"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"id":"edd96ea4-b547-40c0-971a-9d87930c2281"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Use this cell to begin your analysis, and add as many as you would like!\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"4"},"tags":["sample_code"]},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"3d8949b1-9c16-4d87-bf28-0fb9e3f63d63"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read in the csv as a DataFrame\noffice_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/office_episodes.csv', parse_dates=['release_date'])\n\n# Initiatlize two empty lists\ncols = []\nsizes = []\n\n# Iterate through the DataFrame, and assign colors based on the rating\nfor ind, row in office_df.iterrows():\n    if row['scaled_ratings'] < 0.25:\n        cols.append('red')\n    elif row['scaled_ratings'] < 0.50:\n        cols.append('orange')\n    elif row['scaled_ratings'] < 0.75:\n        cols.append('lightgreen')\n    else:\n        cols.append('darkgreen')\n\n# Iterate through the DataFrame, and assign a size based on whether it has guests        \nfor ind, row in office_df.iterrows():\n    if row['has_guests'] == False:\n        sizes.append(25)\n    else:\n        sizes.append(250)\n\n# For ease of plotting, add our lists as columns to the DataFrame\noffice_df['colors'] = cols\noffice_df['sizes'] = sizes\n\n# Split data into guest and non_guest DataFrames\nnon_guest_df = office_df[office_df['has_guests'] == False]\nguest_df = office_df[office_df['has_guests'] == True]\n\n# Set the figure size and plot style        \nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [11, 7]\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\n\n# Create the figure\nfig = plt.figure()\n\n# Create two scatter plots with the episode number on the x axis, and the viewership on the y axis\n\n# Create a normal scatter plot for regular episodes\nplt.scatter(x=non_guest_df.episode_number, y=non_guest_df.viewership_mil, \\\n                 # Assign our color list as the colors and set marker and size\n                 c=non_guest_df['colors'], s=25)\n\n# Create a starred scatterplot for guest star episodes\nplt.scatter(x=guest_df.episode_number, y=guest_df.viewership_mil, \\\n                 # Assign our color list as the colors and set marker and size\n                 c=guest_df['colors'], marker='*', s=250)\n\n# Create a title\nplt.title(\"Popularity, Quality, and Guest Appearances on the Office\", fontsize=28)\n\n# Create an x-axis label\nplt.xlabel(\"Episode Number\", fontsize=18)\n\n# Create a y-axis label\nplt.ylabel(\"Viewership (Millions)\", fontsize=18)\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n# Get the most popular guest star\nprint(office_df[office_df['viewership_mil'] > 20]['guest_stars'])\ntop_star = 'Jessica Alba'","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"4"},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"27eb247b-0126-444c-8a5c-e47040e48451"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"editor":"DataCamp Workspace"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
